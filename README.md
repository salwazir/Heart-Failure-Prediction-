# Heart-Failure-Prediction-


#The-first step of my project was to Compile the data into a comprehensible and organized set. I then started the initial machine learning followed by applying deep learning & neural networks. After that I tuned the algorithms to remove any confounding variables that may interfere with the correct predictions. Next, I tested the different Models, and finally I concluded which is the best algorithm as well as applying the model. All of the machine learning models worked, but in order from highest to lowest accuracy, the Random Forest model did the best, followed by a tie with naive bayes, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. Then another tie with Support Vector, Decision Tree and regular Neural Networks. And lastly the model that worked the worst was K-Nearest Neighbors with 67.21%.
